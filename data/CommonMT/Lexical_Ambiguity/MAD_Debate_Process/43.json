    "reason": "Both candidates accurately captured the meaning of the original Chinese text. They both correctly translated the phrase '一上考场' to mean 'as soon as he entered the examination room' and the phrase '心里就发毛' to mean 'felt nervous'. However, Candidate 1 used the word 'scared' which may be too strong of a word to describe the feeling, while Candidate 2 used the word 'upon' which may not be as natural in English as 'as soon as'. Therefore, the more natural and appropriate translation is Candidate 2's: 'As soon as he entered the exam room, he immediately felt nervous.'",
