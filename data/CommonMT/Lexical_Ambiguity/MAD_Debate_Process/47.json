    "base translation": "After hearing his comforting words, a warm current surged in my heart.",
    "debate translation": "After hearing his comforting words, a warm feeling arose in my heart.",
    "reason": "While both translations are valid interpretations of the original Chinese text, the negative side's translation provides a more accurate metaphorical translation of the expression '一股暖流,' which refers to a feeling of warmth and comfort, rather than an actual flow of liquid. This interpretation is further supported by the phrase '涌上心头,' which implies a sudden rise of emotion. Thus, the correct English translation of the Chinese text '听了他安慰的话，一股暖流涌上心头' is 'After hearing his comforting words, a warm feeling arose in my heart.'",

I can see how \"After hearing his comforting words, a warm feeling arose in my heart\" can more effectively convey the metaphorical and emotional meaning of the original text.\n\nHowever, I still maintain that \"After hearing his comforting words, a warm current surged in my heart\" is a more accurate translation of the original text. While \"current\" may not be an equivalent word for \"一股暖流,\" it better captures the idea of a powerful, ongoing flow of emotion and feeling. \n\nAdditionally, while \"arose\" may be a more appropriate word choice for capturing the sudden nature of the experience, I believe that \"surged\" still accurately conveys the intensity and power of the emotional response described in the original text.\n\nOverall, I acknowledge the interpretive nature of translating metaphorical language, and while both translations convey the basic meaning of the original text, I still stand by my initial translation as the more accurate representation of the original text's intended meaning.\n\nNegative side arguing: Thank you for acknowledging my perspective. While I can see your point about \"current\" capturing the idea of a powerful and ongoing flow of emotion, I do not agree that it is a more accurate translation of the original text.\n\nFirstly, \"一股暖流\" is primarily a metaphorical expression for a feeling of warmth and comfort, and while \"current\" can also convey a sense of continuity and depth, it does not accurately capture the emotional nuance conveyed by the original text.\n\nSecondly, while \"surged\" does convey a sense of intensity and power, it may also imply a sudden or abrupt onset of emotion that may not align with the intended meaning of the original text. \"Arose\" more accurately captures the sudden and spontaneous nature of the emotional experience, without implying force or intensity. \n\nIn conclusion, while both translations convey the basic meaning of the original text in different ways, I believe that \"After hearing his comforting words, a warm feeling arose in my heart\" more accurately represents the metaphorical and emotional nuance of the original text.\n\nYou, as the moderator, will evaluate both sides' translations and determine if there is a clear preference for a translation candidate. If so, please summarize your reasons for supporting affirmative/negative side and give the final translation that you think is correct, and the debate will conclude. If not, the debate will continue to the next round. Now please output your answer in json format, with the format as follows: {\"Whether there is a preference\": \"Yes or No\", \"Supported Side\": \"Affirmative or Negative\", \"Reason\": \"\", \"Correct Translation\": \"\"}"

Lastly, \"涌上心头\" implies that the warm current surged or welled up in the person's heart. \n\nTherefore, the translation \"After hearing his comforting words, a warm current surged in my heart\" provides a clear and accurate representation of the original text, conveying the emotions and feelings expressed by the speaker in the Chinese text.\n\nNegative side arguing: I disagree with your translation, as I believe that \"After hearing his comforting words, a warm feeling arose in my heart\" is a more accurate translation of the Chinese text, \"听了他安慰的话，一股暖流涌上心头.\"\n\nIn the Chinese text, \"一股暖流\" can be literally translated as \"a warm stream,\" but it is a metaphorical expression that refers to a feeling of warmth and comfort. The phrase \"涌上心头\" implies that this warm feeling suddenly arose or sprung up in the person's heart. \n\nTherefore, my suggested translation \"After hearing his comforting words, a warm feeling arose in my heart\" better captures the metaphorical meaning of \"一股暖流涌上心头\" and accurately conveys the emotion expressed by the speaker in the original Chinese text.\n\nNow, what translation candidates do we have?
