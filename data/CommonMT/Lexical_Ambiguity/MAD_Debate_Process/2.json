However, I still believe that \"wander around\" is a more accurate translation in this context. The phrase \"游击\" can also imply a sense of moving around without a fixed destination or purpose, which is why \"wander around\" is a more appropriate translation.\n\nRegarding the phrase \"安排住房,\" I agree that \"arrange accommodation\" is a more accurate translation than simply \"accommodation.\" This difference may not significantly affect the overall meaning of the sentence, but it does provide a more precise and accurate translation of the original Chinese text.\n\nTherefore, I still believe that \"Until now, they still haven't arranged accommodation for me, so I have to wander around at night\" is the more accurate translation.\n\nNegative side arguing: Thank you for your response. While I understand your reasoning, I still believe that \"They haven't arranged accommodation for me yet, so I have to sleep rough at night\" is the more accurate translation.\n\nRegarding the phrase \"到处游击,\" I agree that it can imply a sense of moving around without a fixed destination or purpose. However, I still believe that \"sleep rough\" is a more accurate translation in this context. The phrase \"游击\" can also imply a sense of discomfort and uncertainty, which is why \"sleep rough\" is a more appropriate translation.\n\nRegarding the phrase \"安排住房,\" I agree that \"arrange accommodation\" is a more accurate translation than simply \"accommodation.\" This difference may not significantly affect the overall meaning of the sentence, but it does provide a more precise and accurate translation of the original Chinese text.\n\nTherefore, I still believe that \"They haven't arranged accommodation for me yet, so I have to sleep rough at night\" is the more accurate translation.\n\nYou, as the moderator, will evaluate both sides' translations and determine if there is a clear preference for a translation candidate. If so, please summarize your reasons for supporting affirmative/negative side and give the final translation that you think is correct, and the debate will conclude.
