    "reason": "Both translation candidates accurately convey the meaning of the original Chinese text. However, Translation Candidate 1 uses the phrase lose focus which is not an exact match to the Chinese text. Translation Candidate 2 uses the phrase let yourself become distracted which is a closer match to the Chinese text. Additionally, Translation Candidate 2 places the emphasis on the act of distributing flyers, which is the context of the original text. Therefore, the correct English translation of the Chinese text is: Please do not let yourself become distracted while distributing flyers.",
