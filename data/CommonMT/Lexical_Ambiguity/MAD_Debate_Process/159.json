Additionally, the use of the word 都 implies that all of the chopsticks are made of the same material, and the most common material for chopsticks that are 牙制的 is ivory. Therefore, the correct translation of the Chinese text 他的筷子都是牙制的 is His chopsticks are all made of ivory.",

While I understand your reasoning, I still believe that the correct translation of the Chinese text \"他的筷子都是牙制的\" is \"His chopsticks are all made of bone.\"\n\nFirstly, while \"牙制的\" can indeed mean \"made of ivory,\" it can also mean \"made of bone.\" In fact, bone chopsticks are a common alternative to ivory chopsticks in Chinese culture, especially among ordinary people who cannot afford ivory chopsticks.\n\nSecondly, while ivory chopsticks are a symbol of wealth and status in Chinese culture, they are not as commonly used as wooden or plastic chopsticks. Bone chopsticks, on the other hand, are a more practical and affordable option for everyday use.\n\nLastly, while the use of \"都\" in the Chinese text does imply that all of the chopsticks are made of the same material, it does not necessarily mean that the material is ivory. The context of the sentence and the cultural significance of bone chopsticks in Chinese culture suggest that the material is more likely to be bone than ivory.\n\nTherefore, I respectfully maintain my perspective that the correct translation of the Chinese text is \"His chopsticks are all made of bone.\"\n\nYou, as the moderator, will evaluate both sides' translations and determine if there is a clear preference for a translation candidate. If so, please summarize your reasons for supporting affirmative/negative side and give the final translation that you think is correct, and the debate will conclude.

While I understand your reasoning, I still believe that the correct translation of the Chinese text \"他的筷子都是牙制的\" is \"His chopsticks are all made of ivory.\"\n\nFirstly, while \"牙制的\" can indeed mean \"made of bone,\" it is more commonly used to refer to ivory.

Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the material of the chopsticks is ivory.\n\nSecondly, the use of the possessive pronoun \"他的\" indicates that the chopsticks belong to a male person. This is consistent with the fact that ivory chopsticks are traditionally used by wealthy and influential individuals in Chinese culture.\n\nLastly, the use of the word \"都\" in the Chinese text implies that all of the chopsticks are made of ivory, rather than just some of them. Therefore, the translation \"His chopsticks are all made of ivory\" accurately conveys the meaning of the original text.\n\nNegative side arguing: I disagree with your translation. I believe the correct translation of the Chinese text \"他的筷子都是牙制的\" is \"His chopsticks are all made of bone.\"\n\nFirstly, the word \"牙制的\" in the Chinese text can also mean \"made of bone,\" in addition to ivory. Therefore, it is possible that the material of the chopsticks is bone, rather than ivory.\n\nSecondly, while it is true that ivory chopsticks are traditionally used by wealthy and influential individuals in Chinese culture, bone chopsticks are also commonly used by ordinary people. Therefore, the possessive pronoun \"他的\" does not necessarily indicate that the chopsticks belong to a wealthy or influential person.\n\nLastly, the use of the word \"都\" in the Chinese text implies that all of the chopsticks are made of the same material, but it does not necessarily mean that the material is ivory.
