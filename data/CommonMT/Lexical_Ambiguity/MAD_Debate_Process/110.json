However, the word '扭' in Chinese can have multiple translations, leading to difference in interpretation. While 'broke' implies that the subject successfully stopped their bad habit, 'corrected' can also imply a successful change in behavior. As such, both translations are equally valid and would depend on the context surrounding the original text.Combining the insights from both sides, a more accurate translation would be “He corrected his own bad habit”.",

I can see where you're coming from, but I still believe that \"He broke his own bad habit\" is a more accurate translation.\n\nWhile I agree that \"扭\" doesn't necessarily mean that the action was so forceful that it resulted in breaking the habit, I still believe that the word \"broke\" more accurately captures the sense of the subject actively and successfully overcoming their bad habit. \"Corrected\" could suggest a more general improvement, but \"broke\" emphasizes the subject's ability to stop their negative behavior completely.\n\nRegarding the suggestion that \"broke\" implies a permanent solution that can't be achieved for some habits, I would argue that our understanding of \"broke\" in this context depends on the overall context of the sentence, where it becomes clear whether the negative behavior is likely to recur. Even if the bad habit in question is just temporarily corrected for the time being, \"broke\" still accurately conveys the idea that the subject succeeded in stopping it for a significant period of time.\n\nFinally, while \"corrected\" can cover a range of changes or improvements, I don't believe it fully captures the specific meaning of \"坏习惯\" (bad habit or negative behavior), which \"broke\" more readily implies.\n\nIn summary, while I respect your perspective, I still believe that \"He broke his own bad habit\" is a more accurate rendition of the original Chinese text, primarily because it better conveys the sense of active success in changing negative behavior and the specific concept of a \"bad habit\".\n\nNegative side arguing: Thank you for your thoughtful reply. While I can appreciate your argument, I still disagree that \"He broke his own bad habit\" is the more accurate translation.\n\nFirstly, while \"broke\" may imply a more forceful action than \"corrected,\" I don't believe it accurately captures the full range of possible meanings of \"扭.\" In this context, it likely means that the subject made a deliberate effort to change their behavior, but not necessarily that the change was sudden or forceful.\n\nSecondly, while \"broke\" may imply that the subject succeeded in stopping their negative behavior completely, it also implies a finality that may not be present in the Chinese text. The phrase \"他扭了他自己的坏习惯\" does not necessarily suggest that the subject's bad habit has been permanently eradicated; it simply suggests that the subject made an active effort to correct their behavior.\n\nLastly, while \"broke\" may better convey the specific meaning of \"坏习惯,\" I don't believe that \"corrected\" loses that meaning entirely. \"Corrected\" still suggests that the subject actively worked to improve their behavior, which is the key idea conveyed by \"坏习惯.\"\n\nIn summary, while I can see where you're coming from, I still hold that \"He corrected his own bad habit\" is the more accurate translation of the original Chinese text. It better captures the overall meaning of \"他扭了他自己的坏习惯\" without implying a finality that may not be present in the Chinese text.\n\nYou, as the moderator, will evaluate both sides' translations and determine if there is a clear preference for a translation candidate.

While I understand your points, I still believe \"He broke his own bad habit\" accurately captures the meaning behind the original Chinese text.\n\nWhile \"扭\" doesn't necessarily suggest a sudden or forceful action, I think it implies a deliberate and self-initiated effort to change behavior, which \"broke\" does a better job of portraying in English.\n\nAdditionally, while the Chinese text does not specifically indicate whether the subject's bad habit has been permanently eradicated or not, I don't think \"broke\" necessarily implies a finality either. It could be interpreted as the subject successfully making a significant change in their behavior, without necessarily implying that it's a permanent change.\n\nAlthough \"corrected\"may still suggest an active effort to improve behavior as well, I still believe \"broke\" does a better job of specifically conveying that the subject was able to break their bad habit, which is a key element of the original Chinese text.\n\nOverall, while I understand your points and appreciate the debate, I still hold my belief that \"He broke his own bad habit\" is the more accurate translation.\n\nNegative side arguing: Thank you for your response. While I understand your perspective, I still maintain that \"He corrected his own bad habit\" is the more accurate translation of the original Chinese text.\n\nFirstly, while \"扭\" may imply a deliberate effort to change behavior, it is not necessarily forceful or sudden, and I believe \"corrected\" better captures the idea of a steady, deliberate process of improvement.\n\nSecondly, while \"broke\" may not necessarily imply a finality, it still connotes a complete or drastic change in behavior, which may not always be reflective of the intended meaning of the Chinese text. \"Corrected,\" on the other hand, suggests a more gradual and sustainable change, without implying a complete cessation of the bad habit in question.\n\nLastly, while \"broke\" may more specifically convey the idea of overcoming a bad habit, \"corrected\" is a more accurate rendering of \"坏习惯\" because it encompasses a broader range of negative behaviors or habits that one might need to correct.\n\nOverall, while I appreciate your perspective, I still hold the belief that \"He corrected his own bad habit\" is a more accurate translation of the original Chinese text. It captures the idea of a deliberate, sustainable process of improvement without implying a complete or sudden cessation of the negative behavior.\n\nYou, as the moderator, will evaluate both sides' translations and determine if there is a clear preference for a translation candidate.

Additionally, the phrase \"他自己的\" emphasizes that the subject took responsibility for their actions and made the necessary changes to adjust their behavior.\n\nFurthermore, the phrase \"坏习惯\" specifically refers to a bad habit or negative behavior.

I believe the correct English translation of the Chinese text \"他扭了他自己的坏习惯\" is \"He corrected his own bad habit\". \n\nThe word \"扭\" in Chinese can mean to twist but it can also mean to correct or adjust. In this context, it likely means that the subject corrected their bad habit through effort and hard work. \n\nThe use of \"他自己的\" emphasizes the subject's personal responsibility for their actions and the effort they put into correcting their behavior. \n\nFurthermore, the word \"坏习惯\" specifically means bad habit or negative behavior, so \"corrected\" accurately conveys that the subject made changes to improve their behavior. \n\nIn summary, \"He corrected his own bad habit\" more accurately captures the intended meaning of the Chinese text than \"He broke his own bad habit\".\n\nNow, what translation candidates do we have?
