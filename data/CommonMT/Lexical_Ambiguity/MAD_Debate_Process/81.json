The phrase \"经过多次的锤炼\" emphasizes the importance of going through this process multiple times in order to create something of high quality and value.\n\nThe word \"tempering\" in English accurately captures the essence of this process of hammering and refining.

                "content": "Affirmative side arguing:\nYes, the correct translation is \"Good works require multiple rounds of tempering\".\n\nMy main reason for choosing this translation is that it stays true to the meaning of the original Chinese text. \"锤炼\" in Chinese refers to a process of repeatedly hammering and refining a piece of metal, which requires patience, dedication, and hard work. The phrase \"经过多次的锤炼\" emphasizes the importance of going through this process multiple times in order to create something of high quality and value.\n\nThe word \"tempering\" in English accurately captures the essence of this process of hammering and refining. It conveys the idea of going through a repeated process of strengthening and improving until the final result is strong and resilient. \n\nAdditionally, the phrase \"Good works\" is a good translation for \"好的作品\", which refers to something that is of high quality and has been well-crafted. Therefore, altogether the translation \"Good works require multiple rounds of tempering\" captures the meaning of the original text in a concise and accurate manner.\n\nNegative side arguing: I would argue that a better translation would be \"A good work requires repeated refinement\". \n\nWhile the word \"tempering\" may be an accurate description of the action of hammering and refining a piece of metal, it may not necessarily be the most appropriate word to use when referring to creative works such as art, literature or music. The word \"tempering\" has a connotation of physical strength and durability, which may not be applicable to all forms of creative works. \n\nOn the other hand, the word \"refinement\" captures the idea of making small and subtle improvements over time, which is more applicable when discussing the creation of art or literature. By repeating the process of refinement, a good work can become even better, reflecting the artist's or writer's dedication and attention to detail.\n\nIn conclusion, \"A good work requires repeated refinement\" better captures the spirit of the original Chinese text in a way that is more appropriate for the context of creative works.\n\nNow, what translation candidates do we have? Present them without reasons."
