    "correct reference": "He ofen bribed and soon hot the position of director.",

    "base translation": "He was good at bribery and soon climbed to the position of bureau chief.",
    "debate translation": "He was adept at bribery and soon ascended to the position of bureau chief.",
    "reason": "Both translations accurately convey the meaning of the original Chinese text and capture the tone and implications of the language used. However, the use of the word skilled in candidate 1 is more commonly used in English to describe proficiency in a particular area, while adept in candidate 2 implies a higher level of expertise. Additionally, ascended in candidate 2 implies a smoother and more effortless rise to the position, which is more in line with the tone of the original text. Therefore, the correct English translation of the Chinese text is: He was adept at bribery and soon ascended to the position of bureau chief.",

However, the use of the word 'skilled' in candidate 1 is more commonly used in English to describe proficiency in a particular area, while 'adept' in candidate 2 implies a higher level of expertise.
