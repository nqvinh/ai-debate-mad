Therefore, \"found relief\" is a more appropriate translation.\n\nAdditionally, using \"finally\" in the translation implies a sense of anticipation or waiting, which is not necessarily conveyed in the original Chinese text. \"He\" is also a more accurate translation of \"他\" than \"His,\" as the original text does not specify possession.\n\nOverall, my translation \"He finally found relief from his long-standing troubles\" more accurately conveys the meaning of the original Chinese text.\n\nNow, what translation candidates do we have? Present them without reasons."
