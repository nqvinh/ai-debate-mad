However, I still believe that \"old hand\" is a more accurate and appropriate translation in most cases.\n\nWhile \"老江湖\" can sometimes carry a negative connotation of being cunning and sly, it is not always the case. It can also simply refer to someone who is experienced and knowledgeable in a particular field. Therefore, \"old fox\" may not always be an appropriate translation, as it carries a more negative connotation.\n\nAdditionally, \"old hand\" is a more commonly used idiom in English to describe someone who is experienced and skilled in a particular field. It is a more neutral term that does not necessarily imply any negative connotations.\n\nFurthermore, the context in which \"老江湖\" is used can also affect the appropriate translation. If it is used in a positive context, such as praising someone for their expertise and experience, then \"old hand\" would be a more appropriate translation.\n\nIn conclusion, while \"old fox\" may be an appropriate translation of \"老江湖\" in certain contexts where the negative connotation is more prominent, \"old hand\" is a more accurate and appropriate translation in most cases, as it is a more neutral term that can capture both positive and negative connotations depending on the context.\n\nNegative side arguing: I understand your perspective, and I agree that \"old hand\" can be an appropriate translation of \"老江湖\" in certain contexts where the negative connotation is not prominent.
