Additionally, the use of \"就是\" in the sentence does emphasize a direct correlation between the subject's words and the act of selling youth.\n\nWhile I agree that the use of \"简直\" in this context does suggest a practical similarity between the subject's words and the act of selling youth, I still believe that \"His words are like auctioning off youth\" is a more accurate translation of the Chinese text. This is because \"简直\" can also be translated as \"simply\" or \"just,\" which emphasizes the extreme nature of the comparison being made. It suggests that the subject's words are not just similar to selling youth, but they are so similar that it is almost as if they are actually doing it.\n\nFurthermore, the use of \"practically\" in the translation may imply a more direct connection between the subject's words and the act of selling youth than is intended in the original Chinese text. It may also suggest a more negative connotation than is present in the original text.\n\nTherefore, I still believe that \"His words are like auctioning off youth\" is a more accurate translation of the Chinese text.\n\nNegative side arguing: I can see your point of view, and I agree that \"简直\" can also be translated as \"simply\" or \"just,\" emphasizing the extreme nature of the comparison being made. It suggests that the subject's words are not just similar to selling youth, but they are so similar that it is almost as if they are actually doing it.\n\nHowever, I still believe that \"His words are practically selling youth\" is a more accurate translation of the Chinese text. While \"practically\" may imply a more direct connection between the subject's words and the act of selling youth than is intended in the original Chinese text, I believe that it accurately captures the practical similarity between the two.\n\nAdditionally, I do not believe that \"practically\" necessarily suggests a more negative connotation than is present in the original text. It simply suggests that the subject's words are similar to the act of selling youth in a practical sense.\n\nTherefore, I still believe that \"His words are practically selling youth\" is a more accurate translation of the Chinese text.\n\nYou, as the moderator, will evaluate both sides' translations and determine if there is a clear preference for a translation candidate.
