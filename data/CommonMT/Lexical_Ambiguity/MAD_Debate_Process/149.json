They will present their translations and discuss their perspectives on the correct English translation of the given Chinese text: \"明天拔河比赛，我们公司将会全军都出动。\". At the end of each round, you will evaluate the candidates' translation submissions based on the following criteria:\n1. Accuracy: The degree to which the translation captures the original meaning of the source text.\n2. Fluency: The readability and naturalness of the translation in English."

I believe the correct translation of the Chinese text \"明天拔河比赛，我们公司将会全军都出动\" is \"Tomorrow is the tug-of-war competition, and our entire company will participate.\"\n\nWhile \"拔河比赛\" can be translated as \"tug-of-war competition,\" the phrase \"全军都出动\" does not necessarily mean \"mobilize all troops.\" It can also mean \"everyone will participate\" or \"everyone will be involved.\" In this context, it is more likely that the speaker is saying that everyone in the company will participate in the competition, rather than just being mobilized to attend.\n\nTherefore, the translation \"Tomorrow is the tug-of-war competition, and our entire company will participate\" accurately conveys the meaning of the original Chinese text.\n\nNow, what translation candidates do we have?
