Here are my reasons:\n\nFirstly, while \"未被发掘的人才\" can be translated as \"untapped talent,\" it can also be translated as \"undiscovered talent.\" Both translations are valid, but \"undiscovered\" more accurately conveys the idea that these talents have not yet been recognized or given the opportunity to showcase their abilities.\n\nSecondly, while \"援引\" can be translated as \"to draw on\" or \"to tap into,\" it more commonly means \"to cite\" or \"to quote.\" This implies that the person in question is able to identify and bring attention to these undiscovered talents, rather than actively utilizing them.\n\nLastly, while \"discovering\" accurately conveys the idea that the person in question is able to find and bring attention to these talents, it does not capture the full meaning of \"援引.\" \"Citing\" or \"quoting\" implies a level of recognition and acknowledgement of these talents, which \"discovering\" alone may not convey.\n\nTherefore, I still believe that \"He is good at citing undiscovered talents\" is the more accurate translation.\n\nNegative side arguing: Thank you for your response.
