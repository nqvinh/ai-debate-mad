Just as a joint in the body can become stuck or immobile, any aspect of a task can become difficult or problematic.\n\nOverall, this translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original Chinese text by highlighting the challenges of completing tasks and the potential for difficulties to arise at any point.\n\nNegative side arguing: I agree with your translation that \"办事真不容易\" can be translated as \"It's really not easy to get things done.\" However, I believe that the phrase \"哪一个关节都可能卡壳\" should be translated as \"Any link in the chain can get stuck.\"\n\nThe word \"关节\" in Chinese can refer to joints in the body, but it can also be used metaphorically to refer to links in a chain or connections in a process. Therefore, the phrase \"哪一个关节都可能卡壳\" is better translated as \"Any link in the chain can get stuck,\" which conveys the idea that any part of a process can become problematic and cause difficulties in completing a task.\n\nThis translation accurately captures the metaphorical use of the word \"关节\" and conveys the same meaning as the original Chinese text.\n\nNow, what translation candidates do we have?
