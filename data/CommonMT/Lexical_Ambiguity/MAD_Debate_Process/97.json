However, in this context, it is being used metaphorically to describe the negative impact on the body after days of continuous work. \n\nSecondly, the phrase \"在连续工作了数天后\" (zài liánxù gōngzuò le shù tiān hòu) means \"after working continuously for several days\", indicating that the body has been subjected to prolonged strain and fatigue. \n\nTherefore, \"His body suffered losses after working continuously for several days\" is an accurate and appropriate translation that captures the meaning of the original Chinese text.\n\nNegative side arguing: Actually, I think that the correct translation of the Chinese text \"他的身体在连续工作了数天后亏损了\" is \"His body was depleted after working continuously for several days.\"\n\nThe word \"亏损\" (kuīsǔn), as you mentioned, is often used in financial contexts and means \"loss\" or \"deficit\".
