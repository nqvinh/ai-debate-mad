Therefore, the term \"making New Year's purchases\" more accurately reflects the meaning of the original Chinese text.\n\nSecondly, the term \"年货\" refers specifically to the goods that are traditionally bought and consumed during the Chinese New Year, such as snacks, candies, and other festive items. The term \"New Year's purchases\" more accurately reflects this specific context.\n\nTherefore, I believe that \"Many families are making New Year's purchases\" is a more accurate translation of the original Chinese text.\n\nNow, what translation candidates do we have? Present them without reasons."
