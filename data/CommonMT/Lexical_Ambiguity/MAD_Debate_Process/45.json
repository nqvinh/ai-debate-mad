The English translation \"is reading books\" captures this emphasis effectively.\n\nOverall, \"His hobby is reading books\" is a clear and concise translation that accurately conveys the meaning and emphasis of the original Chinese text. While \"delving into books\" may be a valid alternative translation, I believe that \"reading books\" is a more commonly used and easily understood phrase that accurately captures the meaning of the original text.\n\nNegative side arguing: Thank you for your response. While I understand your reasoning, I still believe that \"His hobby is delving into books\" is a more accurate translation of the Chinese text \"他的爱好就是钻书本.\"\n\nFirstly, while \"钻\" can also mean \"to read thoroughly\" or \"to study intensively,\" it is often used in the context of reading books to mean \"to delve into\" or \"to explore deeply.\" Therefore, \"delving into books\" more accurately conveys the meaning of the original text.\n\nSecondly, while \"reading books\" may suggest an active pursuit of knowledge, it may also suggest a more passive activity. \"Delving into books,\" on the other hand, implies a more active and engaged pursuit of knowledge and understanding.\n\nAdditionally, while \"reading books\" may be a more commonly used phrase in English, it may not fully capture the depth and intensity of the person's hobby as emphasized in the original Chinese text.\n\nFurthermore, the phrase \"就是\" in the Chinese text emphasizes that the person's hobby is solely delving into books and nothing else. The English translation \"is delving into books\" captures this emphasis effectively.\n\nOverall, \"His hobby is delving into books\" is a more precise and nuanced translation that accurately conveys the meaning and emphasis of the original Chinese text. While \"reading books\" may be a valid alternative translation, I believe that \"delving into books\" more accurately captures the meaning and connotations of the original text.\n\nYou, as the moderator, will evaluate both sides' translations and determine if there is a clear preference for a translation candidate.
