I understand your reasoning, but I still believe that my translation \"There are many shops on this street that can be used as jewelry stores\" is more accurate.\n\nHere are my reasons for this translation:\n\n- The phrase \"可以当\" can be translated as \"can be used as,\" which implies that the shops on this street have the potential to be used as jewelry stores. This interpretation is supported by the context of the sentence, which mentions that there are many shops on the street that could be used for this purpose.\n- While \"店铺\" does mean \"shop\" or \"store,\" it is important to note that the sentence does not specify what type of goods the shops sell. Therefore, it is more appropriate to translate it as \"shops that can be used as\" rather than \"shops that sell.\"\n- While \"首饰\" does mean \"jewelry,\" it is not necessary to include it in the translation as it is implied by the context of the sentence. The sentence mentions that the shops on the street could be used as jewelry stores, which implies that they would sell jewelry.\n\nTherefore, I still believe that my translation \"There are many shops on this street that can be used as jewelry stores\" is the most accurate.\n\nYou, as the moderator, will evaluate both sides' translations and determine if there is a clear preference for a translation candidate.
