The phrase 你别起火了 implies that the person is currently feeling angry or upset and needs to calm down, which is better conveyed by the translation Dont get angry, keep a calm mood. The second translation, Dont start a fire, keep a calm mood, while also valid, does not fully capture the emotional state of the person in the original text.",
