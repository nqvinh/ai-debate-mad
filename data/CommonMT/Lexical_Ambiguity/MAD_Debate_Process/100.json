    "reason": "The original Chinese sentence uses the verb 引用 (cite), the object 他的亲戚 (his relatives), and the modifier 都是 (all are). The subject is 他 (he). This sentence construction means that the subject is limiting the scope of what they cite to only their relatives. 'Only' is an important modifier to emphasize that he cites nothing but his relatives which is captured well by the translation 'only.' Furthermore, his relatives are clearly identified by the modifier 他的 (his), which is translated accurately as 'his relatives'. Therefore, the most accurate and faithful translation of the Chinese sentence “他引用的都是他的亲戚。” is 'He only cites his relatives.'",

                "content": "Affirmative side arguing:\nI agree that the correct translation of the Chinese sentence \"他引用的都是他的亲戚\" is \"He only cites his relatives.\"\n\nMy reason for this translation is based on a close examination of the Chinese sentence structure and the meanings of each word. The subject of the sentence is \"他\" (he), which is followed by the verb \"引用\" (cite). The object of the verb is \"他的亲戚\" (his relatives), which is preceded by the modifier \"都是\" (all are).\n\nBy translating the sentence as \"he only cites his relatives,\" we are able to capture the meaning of the sentence in a clear and concise manner. The use of the word \"only\" emphasizes the limited scope of the person's citations, and the word \"relatives\" clearly identifies the type of people being cited. This translation accurately conveys the intended meaning of the original Chinese sentence.\n\nNegative side arguing: I actually agree with your translation, \"He only cites his relatives,\" for several reasons. Firstly, the word \"都是\" (all are) emphasizes that the only people being cited are his relatives, which is captured well by the word \"only\" in your translation. Secondly, the phrase \"他的亲戚\" (his relatives) is specific and unambiguous, and is accurately translated as \"his relatives\" in your version. Finally, the verb \"引用\" (cite) is straightforward and clear, and is accurately translated as \"cites\" in your version.\n\nBased on this analysis, I think your translation is the most accurate and faithful to the original Chinese sentence. Unless you have a different opinion, I think we can conclude that \"He only cites his relatives\" is indeed the correct English translation of the Chinese text provided.\n\nNow, what translation candidates do we have? Present them without reasons."

This sentence construction means that the subject is limiting the scope of what they cite to only their relatives. 'Only' is an important modifier to emphasize that he cites nothing but his relatives which is captured well by the translation 'only.' Furthermore, his relatives are clearly identified by the modifier 他的 (his), which is translated accurately as 'his relatives'. Therefore, the most accurate and faithful translation of the Chinese sentence “他引用的都是他的亲戚。” is 'He only cites his relatives.'\",\n  \"Correct Translation\": \"He only cites his relatives.\"\n}"
