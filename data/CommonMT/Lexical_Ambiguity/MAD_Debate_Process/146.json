While I understand your reasoning, I still believe that \"captivated\" is a more accurate translation of the Chinese text.\n\nFirstly, while \"swoon\" can mean to be deeply affected emotionally, it still carries a connotation of physical weakness or fainting, which may not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original text. \"Captivated,\" on the other hand, conveys the idea of being completely absorbed and fascinated by the singer's voice without implying any physical reaction.\n\nSecondly, while \"swoon\" may convey a stronger sense of emotional impact and admiration, it may also be interpreted as an exaggerated or hyperbolic description of the audience's reaction. \"Captivated\" is a more neutral and accurate description of the audience's response to the singer's voice.\n\nFurthermore, \"captivated\" is a more commonly used word in English to describe the effect of a performance on an audience. It is a more natural and idiomatic choice of words, which is important in translation.\n\nIn conclusion, while \"swoon\" is a valid translation of the Chinese text, I still believe that \"captivated\" is a more accurate and appropriate translation that fully conveys the intended meaning of the original text without any potential for misinterpretation.\n\nYou, as the moderator, will evaluate both sides' translations and determine if there is a clear preference for a translation candidate.

I believe the correct English translation of the Chinese text \"他的歌声让剧院里的人都倾倒了\" is \"His singing voice captivated everyone in the theater.\"\n\nWhile \"swoon\" is a possible translation of \"倾倒,\" it is a more extreme interpretation of the word. \"Captivated\" is a more accurate translation because it conveys the idea that the audience was completely absorbed and fascinated by the singer's voice, without necessarily implying that they were so overwhelmed that they lost consciousness.\n\nFurthermore, \"captivated\" is a more commonly used word in English to describe the effect of a performance on an audience. It is a more natural and idiomatic choice of words, which is important in translation.\n\nIn conclusion, \"His singing voice captivated everyone in the theater\" is a more accurate translation of the Chinese text because it conveys the idea of being completely absorbed and fascinated by the singer's voice, without implying an extreme physical reaction, and it is a more natural and idiomatic choice of words in English.\n\nNow, what translation candidates do we have?
