While I understand your reasoning, I still believe that \"If he resigns, no one can match his work\" is a more accurate translation of the original Chinese text.\n\nHere are my counterpoints:\n\n- While \"抵\" (dǐ) can be interpreted as \"to replace\" or \"to substitute,\" it is not the most common usage of the word in this context. The emphasis on the person's irreplaceable work is better conveyed through the phrase \"match his work.\"\n- The phrase \"fill his position\" in your translation may imply that someone else can take on the person's responsibilities, but it does not fully capture the meaning of the original text. The phrase \"fill his position\" may also imply that the person's work is not unique or exceptional, which is not the case in this context.\n- The word \"match\" in my translation acknowledges the person's unique and exceptional work, while also emphasizing that it cannot be easily replicated or surpassed.\n\nOverall, I still believe that \"If he resigns, no one can match his work\" is a more accurate and nuanced translation of the original Chinese text.\n\nYou, as the moderator, will evaluate both sides' translations and determine if there is a clear preference for a translation candidate. If so, please summarize your reasons for supporting affirmative/negative side and give the final translation that you think is correct, and the debate will conclude. If not, the debate will continue to the next round. Now please output your answer in json format, with the format as follows: {\"Whether there is a preference\": \"Yes or No\", \"Supported Side\": \"Affirmative or Negative\", \"Reason\": \"\", \"Correct Translation\": \"\"}"
