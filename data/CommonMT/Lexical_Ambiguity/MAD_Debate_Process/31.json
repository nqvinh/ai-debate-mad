In my opinion, a more accurate translation of the Chinese text \"如果不用心，就治不好学\" would be \"If you don't study with diligence, you won't make progress.\" \n\nMy reasoning for this translation is as follows: \n\n- The Chinese phrase \"用心\" literally means \"use heart\" or \"use mind,\" which implies putting in effort and concentration. Therefore, \"study with diligence\" better captures the meaning of \"用心\" than \"put in effort\" alone. \n- The word \"治\" in the Chinese text can mean \"cure,\" but in this context, it is used metaphorically to mean \"make progress\" or \"improve.\" \n- The phrase \"治不好学\" is a common Chinese idiom that means \"unable to make progress in learning.\" Therefore, the translation \"you won't make progress\" is more accurate than \"you can't cure your studies.\" \n\nI look forward to hearing your thoughts on this translation."
