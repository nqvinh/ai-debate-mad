    "reason": "The phrase '现在市场不好' can be translated as 'the market is not good now' or 'the market is bad now.' However, 'not good' is a more accurate and neutral translation. The phrase '赶紧' can be translated as 'quickly' or 'hurry up.' In this context, 'quickly' is a more appropriate translation as it conveys a sense of urgency without being too forceful. The phrase '把手中的货物抛出去' can be translated as 'sell off the goods in hand.' '抛出去' literally means 'throw out,' but in this context, it means to sell off quickly. '手中的货物' refers to the goods in hand, which means the goods that the person currently has in their possession.",
