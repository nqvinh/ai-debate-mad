In the context of this sentence, it is more likely that the woman is being considered for marriage as a potential daughter-in-law, rather than being formally betrothed or engaged.\n\nSecondly, while \"做媳妇儿\" can be translated as \"to become a wife,\" it is more specifically used to refer to becoming a daughter-in-law in Chinese culture. The term \"媳妇\" is often used to refer to a wife in general, but the addition of \"做\" (to become/to be) and \"儿\" (a diminutive suffix) suggests a more specific meaning of becoming a daughter-in-law.\n\nFurthermore, the use of \"聘\" in this context suggests that the woman is being considered for a formal arrangement, rather than just a casual relationship. The use of \"谁也不愿意\" (no one wants to) suggests that the woman is being rejected as a potential daughter-in-law, rather than just as a potential spouse.\n\nTherefore, based on the context and the more common usage of the words in the sentence, I still believe that \"No one wants to hire her as a daughter-in-law\" is the more accurate translation.\n\nNegative side arguing: Thank you for your response. While I understand your reasoning, I still believe that \"No one wants to marry her\" is the more accurate translation.\n\nFirstly, while \"聘\" can mean \"to hire\" or \"to engage,\" it can also mean \"to betroth\" or \"to marry\" in the context of a formal agreement for marriage.

In this context, it suggests that the woman in question is being considered for marriage, rather than just a casual relationship.\n\nSecondly, the phrase \"做媳妇儿\" literally translates to \"to be a daughter-in-law,\" which is a common term used in Chinese culture to refer to a woman who marries into a family and becomes a part of her husband's household.\n\nTherefore, based on the context and the literal translation of the Chinese text, it is reasonable to conclude that the correct English translation is \"No one wants to hire her as a daughter-in-law.\"\n\nNegative side arguing: Yes, I disagree with your translation. I believe the correct English translation of the Chinese text \"谁也不愿意聘她做媳妇儿\" is \"No one wants to marry her.\"\n\nWhile \"聘\" can mean \"to hire\" or \"to engage,\" it can also mean \"to betroth\" or \"to marry\" in the context of a formal agreement for marriage.
