While I understand your reasoning, I still believe that \"Goods must go through customs at the entrance\" is a more accurate translation.\n\nFirstly, \"要\" can indeed indicate a future action, but in this context, it is more commonly used to indicate obligation or necessity. The sentence is discussing the requirement for goods to pass through customs at the entrance, which implies an obligation or necessity.\n\nSecondly, \"经过\" does imply that the action is completed, but it also implies that the action is completed at a certain location. In this case, the location is the entrance. Therefore, \"Goods must go through customs at the entrance\" accurately conveys that the action of passing through customs is both required and completed at the entrance.\n\nFinally, \"Goods must go through customs at the entrance\" is also concise and clear, making it easy for English speakers to understand the meaning of the original Chinese text.\n\nIn conclusion, while I appreciate your perspective, I still believe that \"Goods must go through customs at the entrance\" is the most accurate translation of the Chinese text \"货物入口要经过海关.\"\n\nNegative side arguing: Thank you for your response. While I understand your reasoning, I still believe that \"Goods entering must pass through customs\" is a more accurate translation.\n\nFirstly, while \"要\" can indicate obligation or necessity, it can also indicate a future action that is required or necessary. Therefore, \"Goods entering must pass through customs\" accurately conveys the future action that is required.\n\nSecondly, \"经过\" does imply that the action is completed at a certain location, but it does not necessarily imply that the location is the entrance. Therefore, \"Goods entering must pass through customs\" accurately conveys that the action of passing through customs is required, without implying any additional meaning about the location.\n\nFinally, \"Goods entering must pass through customs\" is also concise and clear, making it easy for English speakers to understand the meaning of the original Chinese text.\n\nIn conclusion, while I appreciate your perspective, I still believe that \"Goods entering must pass through customs\" is the most accurate translation of the Chinese text \"货物入口要经过海关.\"\n\nYou, as the moderator, will evaluate both sides' translations and determine if there is a clear preference for a translation candidate.

                "content": "Affirmative side arguing:\nYes, I believe the correct translation of the Chinese text \"货物入口要经过海关\" is \"Goods must go through customs at the entrance.\"\n\nFirstly, \"货物\" means \"goods\" or \"merchandise\" in English. \"入口\" means \"entrance\" or \"gateway.\" \"要\" is a modal particle that indicates necessity or obligation. \"经过\" means \"to go through\" or \"to pass through.\" Finally, \"海关\" means \"customs\" in English.\n\nTherefore, when we put all these words together, the most accurate translation would be \"Goods must go through customs at the entrance.\" This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original Chinese text, which is that any goods entering a certain area or country must pass through customs at the entrance.\n\nAdditionally, this translation is concise and clear, making it easy for English speakers to understand the meaning of the original Chinese text.\n\nNegative side arguing: I disagree with your translation. I believe the correct English translation of the Chinese text \"货物入口要经过海关\" is \"Goods entering must pass through customs.\"\n\nWhile your translation is close, it is not entirely accurate. The word \"要\" in the Chinese text does not necessarily indicate obligation or necessity, but rather it can also mean \"will\" or \"shall.\" Therefore, the phrase \"货物入口要经过海关\" can also be translated as \"Goods entering will pass through customs\" or \"Goods entering shall pass through customs.\"\n\nFurthermore, the word \"要\" in this context implies a future action, rather than a present obligation. Therefore, the phrase \"Goods must go through customs at the entrance\" may not accurately convey the future tense implied in the original Chinese text.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Goods entering must pass through customs\" is a more accurate translation that conveys the future tense and the meaning of the original Chinese text.\n\nNow, what translation candidates do we have? Present them without reasons."
