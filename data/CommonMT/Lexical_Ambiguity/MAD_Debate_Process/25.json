In this case, it is used metaphorically to emphasize the importance of taking a walk after dinner as a daily routine for the person in question.\n\nTherefore, the translation \"Taking a walk after dinner is his mandatory course\" accurately conveys the meaning of the original Chinese text.\n\nNegative side arguing: I believe the correct translation is: \"Taking a walk after dinner is his daily routine.\"\n\nWhile \"必修课\" can be translated as \"mandatory course,\" in this context, it is used metaphorically to emphasize the importance of taking a walk after dinner as a daily routine for the person in question. It does not necessarily mean that it is mandatory or required, but rather a habit or practice that the person regularly follows.\n\nAdditionally, \"必修课\" is commonly used in the context of education, but in this sentence, it is used in a more colloquial way. Therefore, \"daily routine\" is a more appropriate translation in this case.\n\nOverall, \"Taking a walk after dinner is his daily routine\" accurately conveys the meaning of the original Chinese text.\n\nNow, what translation candidates do we have?
