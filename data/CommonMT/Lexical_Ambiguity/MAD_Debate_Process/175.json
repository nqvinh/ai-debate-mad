I understand your perspective, but I still believe that my translation is more accurate.\n\nWhile \"要\" can indicate intention or plan, it can also indicate necessity or obligation. In this context, I believe that the latter interpretation is more appropriate, as the sentence describes someone who is preparing for a performance at an evening party. It is reasonable to assume that the songs are part of a pre-planned program for the party, and that the subject is writing the lyrics for the songs that need to be sung.\n\nRegarding the use of possessive pronouns, while it is true that including \"he\" clarifies that the subject is both the writer and performer of the songs, I believe that this information can be inferred from the context of the sentence. The sentence describes someone who is writing lyrics for a performance, which implies that they are also the performer. Therefore, I do not believe that the possessive pronoun is necessary in the translation.\n\nTherefore, I still believe that my translation, \"He is currently writing the lyrics for the songs that will be sung at tomorrow's evening party,\" is the more accurate interpretation of the original Chinese text.\n\nYou, as the moderator, will evaluate both sides' translations and determine if there is a clear preference for a translation candidate. If so, please summarize your reasons for supporting affirmative/negative side and give the final translation that you think is correct, and the debate will conclude. If not, the debate will continue to the next round. Now please output your answer in json format, with the format as follows: {\"Whether there is a preference\": \"Yes or No\", \"Supported Side\": \"Affirmative or Negative\", \"Reason\": \"\", \"Correct Translation\": \"\"}"

I appreciate your perspective, but I still believe that my initial translation is more accurate.\n\nWhile \"要\" can indicate necessity or obligation, it can also indicate intention or plan.
