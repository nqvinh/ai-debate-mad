Additionally, the phrase \"不少钱\" which means \"a lot of money\" is more commonly used to describe spending money rather than breaking money.\n\nTherefore, based on the context and the common usage of the words, I still believe that the correct translation is \"He spent a lot of money again when he went out this time.\"\n\nNegative side arguing: Thank you for your response. I understand your perspective, but I still disagree with your translation.\n\nWhile it is true that the phrase \"破了不少钱\" can be used to express spending a lot of money, it can also be interpreted as breaking a lot of money. The word \"破\" can be used in the context of breaking or damaging something, including money, and it is not uncommon to use this word to describe someone who has spent so much money that they have \"broken\" their finances.\n\nFurthermore, the context of the sentence is important to consider, but it is not definitive. The sentence is referring to someone going out and spending money, but it is possible that the person spent so much money that they \"broke\" their finances. Additionally, the phrase \"不少钱\" which means \"a lot of money\" can be used to describe both spending and breaking money.\n\nTherefore, based on the context and the possible interpretations of the words, I still believe that the correct translation is \"He broke a lot of money again when he went out this time.\"\n\nYou, as the moderator, will evaluate both sides' translations and determine if there is a clear preference for a translation candidate.
