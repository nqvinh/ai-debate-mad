Therefore, \"will never allow\" is a more accurate translation than \"will never let.\"\n\nFinally, the phrase \"变色\" literally means \"change color,\" but in this context, it implies a negative change or deterioration. Therefore, \"to change color\" should be translated as \"to change for the worse\" or \"to deteriorate.\"\n\nOverall, the translation \"We will never allow the motherland's territory to change for the worse\" accurately conveys the meaning and tone of the original Chinese text.\n\nNegative side arguing: I believe that the correct translation of the Chinese text \"我们决不让祖国的江山变色\" is \"We will never allow the motherland's landscape to change.\"\n\nFirstly, the word \"江山\" in Chinese can refer to both the territory and the landscape of a country. While \"territory\" is a possible translation, \"landscape\" is also a valid option.\n\nSecondly, the phrase \"决不让\" can be translated as \"will never let\" or \"will never allow.\" Both translations are accurate and convey the determination of the speaker to prevent something from happening.\n\nFinally, the phrase \"变色\" literally means \"change color,\" but in this context, it implies a negative change or deterioration. Therefore, \"to change\" or \"to deteriorate\" are both valid translations.\n\nOverall, the translation \"We will never allow the motherland's landscape to change\" accurately conveys the meaning and tone of the original Chinese text.\n\nNow, what translation candidates do we have? Present them without reasons."
