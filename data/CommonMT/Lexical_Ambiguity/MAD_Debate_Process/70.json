                "content": "Affirmative side arguing:\nI disagree with your translation. A more accurate translation of \"车祸横生\" would be \"car accidents occur frequently\" or \"car accidents happen often\". \n\nThe word \"横生\" in the original Chinese text means \"to occur frequently\" or \"to happen often\". It doesn't necessarily mean that car accidents are happening at this very moment, but rather that they happen frequently in general. \n\nUsing the word \"frequently\" instead of \"happen\" in the translation better conveys the sense of repetition implied by the original text. Additionally, the word \"often\" can also be used interchangeably with \"frequently\" in this context. \n\nTherefore, \"car accidents occur frequently\" or \"car accidents happen often\" would be a more accurate translation of the original Chinese text.\n\nNegative side arguing: I agree with your translation that \"车祸横生\" refers to the frequent occurrence of car accidents. However, I believe that a more accurate translation would be \"car accidents are rampant\" or \"car accidents are rampant and widespread\". \n\nThe word \"横生\" in the original Chinese text has a connotation of something spreading uncontrollably or running rampant. Therefore, using the word \"rampant\" in the translation better conveys the sense of the situation being out of control and widespread. \n\nAdditionally, adding the word \"widespread\" emphasizes the fact that car accidents are not just happening frequently, but they are also happening in many different places and affecting many people. \n\nTherefore, \"car accidents are rampant\" or \"car accidents are rampant and widespread\" would be a more accurate translation of the original Chinese text.\n\nNow, what translation candidates do we have? Present them without reasons."
