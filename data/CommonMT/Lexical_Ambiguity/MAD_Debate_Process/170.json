At the end of each round, you will evaluate the candidates' translation submissions based on the following criteria:\n1. Accuracy: The degree to which the translation captures the original meaning of the source text.\n2. Fluency: The readability and naturalness of the translation in English."

In my opinion, the correct translation of the Chinese text \"听完这句话，他的心里很透亮\" is \"After hearing this sentence, he felt enlightened\". \n\nMy reason for this is that the term \"透亮\" carries a more profound and insightful connotation than simply \"clear\". It translates to \"transparently bright\" and can be construed to indicate a deep sense of understanding or realization. \n\nAdditionally, the use of the word \"enlightened\" seems appropriate in capturing this meaning of the Chinese phrase. It conveys the idea of gaining new knowledge or wisdom, which can be implied by the Chinese words in question.\n\nThus, the translated text \"After hearing this sentence, he felt enlightened\" seems to capture the actual meaning of the Chinese text more accurately than \"After hearing this sentence, his heart was very clear\".\n\nNow, what translation candidates do we have? Present them without reasons."
