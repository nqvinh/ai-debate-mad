Therefore, \"白了他一眼\" means that someone is giving another person a look of contempt or disdain.\n\nThe phrase \"Gave him a white eye\" accurately conveys the meaning of the original Chinese text and is a commonly used English expression to describe this gesture. Therefore, I believe it is the correct translation.\n\nNegative side arguing: I disagree with your translation. I believe the correct translation of \"白了他一眼\" is \"Gave him a glance.\"\n\nWhile \"白眼\" can indeed mean a gesture of contempt or disdain in Chinese culture, the context of the sentence is important in determining the correct translation. In this case, we do not have any additional context to suggest that the person is giving a look of contempt or disdain.\n\nInstead, \"白了他一眼\" can also mean giving someone a quick glance or a brief look. The use of \"白\" in this context can be interpreted as a quick or fleeting action. Therefore, \"Gave him a glance\" accurately conveys the meaning of the original Chinese text and is a commonly used English expression to describe a quick look.\n\nIn conclusion, while \"Gave him a white eye\" may be a valid translation in certain contexts, I believe \"Gave him a glance\" is the more accurate translation in this particular case.\n\nNow, what translation candidates do we have? Present them without reasons."
