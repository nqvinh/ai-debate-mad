I understand your perspective on using \"high pressure\" as a more appropriate and commonly used term in English. However, I still believe that \"systolic pressure\" is a more accurate and precise translation in this context.\n\nWhile the original Chinese text does not explicitly state that the measurement is being taken in a medical context, the fact that the worker is having his blood pressure measured in a hospital strongly implies a medical context. In a medical context, \"高压\" specifically refers to systolic pressure, which is the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats. Therefore, using \"systolic pressure\" would be more precise and specific to the medical context of the original text.\n\nFurthermore, while \"high pressure\" may be more commonly used in English, it is important to consider the accuracy and precision of the translation. In a medical context, using the correct terminology is crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, using \"systolic pressure\" would be more appropriate for medical professionals or those familiar with medical terminology.\n\nOverall, I believe that \"systolic pressure\" is a more accurate and precise translation of \"高压\" in this context, as it specifically refers to the pressure being measured in a medical context. While \"high pressure\" may be more commonly used in English, it may not accurately convey the intended meaning in a medical context.\n\nNegative side arguing: Thank you for your response.
