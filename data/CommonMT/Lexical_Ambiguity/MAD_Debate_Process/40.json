    "reason": "The affirmative side presented a more convincing argument by emphasizing the literal meaning of the Chinese characters 往外倒 and 粪, as well as the cultural context in which this phrase is used. The use of metaphorical language in Chinese makes it difficult to determine a clear and definitive translation without further context, but the affirmative sides interpretation is more supported by the literal meaning of the Chinese text and the cultural context. Therefore, the correct translation is That woman is spitting out feces from her mouth.",
