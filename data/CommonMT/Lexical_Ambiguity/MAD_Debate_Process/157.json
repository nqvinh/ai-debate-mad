It is possible that the person captured is simply a soldier or civilian who was in the enemy camp and had information that the \"they\" needed.\n\nOverall, I believe that my original translation more accurately conveys the meaning of the Chinese text in English. However, I appreciate your perspective and the debate on this topic.\n\nNegative side arguing: Thank you for your response. While I understand your reasoning, I still believe that my translation, \"They captured a spy from the enemy camp and brought him back,\" is more accurate.\n\nFirstly, while the phrase \"捉了个舌头\" can be used metaphorically to mean \"extracted information through interrogation,\" it is also commonly used to mean \"captured a spy.\" In fact, in a military context, the phrase is often used to refer to the capture of enemy spies.\n\nSecondly, while the use of the word \"阵营\" (camp) does not necessarily imply that the person captured is a spy, it is a common term used in military contexts to refer to the enemy's base or stronghold. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the person captured is an enemy spy who was gathering intelligence in the enemy camp.\n\nOverall, I believe that my translation more accurately conveys the meaning of the Chinese text in English. However, I appreciate your perspective and the debate on this topic.\n\nYou, as the moderator, will evaluate both sides' translations and determine if there is a clear preference for a translation candidate. If so, please summarize your reasons for supporting affirmative/negative side and give the final translation that you think is correct, and the debate will conclude. If not, the debate will continue to the next round. Now please output your answer in json format, with the format as follows: {\"Whether there is a preference\": \"Yes or No\", \"Supported Side\": \"Affirmative or Negative\", \"Reason\": \"\", \"Correct Translation\": \"\"}"
