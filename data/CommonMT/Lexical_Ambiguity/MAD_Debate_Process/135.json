In the context of a storm, it is reasonable to assume that the seawater would rise up due to the strong winds and waves.\n\nSecondly, the use of the preposition \"在\" indicates that the seawater is the subject of the sentence and that it is actively rising up during the storm. This is further supported by the use of the verb \"起立\" which implies an intentional and active movement.\n\nTherefore, \"The seawater rose up during this storm\" accurately conveys the meaning of the original Chinese text.\n\nNegative side arguing: I actually agree with your translation, \"The seawater rose up during this storm,\" as the most accurate English translation of the Chinese text \"海水在这次暴风雨中起立.\" \n\nAs you mentioned, the Chinese word \"起立\" literally means \"to stand up\" or \"to rise up,\" which implies a sudden and forceful movement.
