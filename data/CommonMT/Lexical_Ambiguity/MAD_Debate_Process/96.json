The phrase \"肯定会\" can be translated to \"definitely\", indicating the certainty of facing obstacles.\n\nFurthermore, the phrase \"干出大事业\" can be translated to \"achieve great success\" or \"accomplish great things\" which suggests that there will be a significant accomplishment at the end of the journey. This is supported by the use of the word \"大\" which means \"great\".\n\nOverall, the translation \"If you want to achieve great success, you will definitely stumble and fall\" captures the essence of the Chinese text and conveys the message that success requires perseverance in the face of challenges.\n\nNegative side arguing: Actually, I do not disagree with your translation, as I believe it is an accurate representation of the meaning conveyed in the original Chinese text.\n\nIn fact, the translation \"If you want to achieve great success, you will definitely stumble and fall\" captures the essence of the Chinese saying which is that setbacks and failures are an inevitable part of the journey towards success.\n\nThe phrase \"干出大事业\" signifies a significant accomplishment and the words \"肯定会\" denote an unavoidable occurrence.\n\nMoreover, \"摔跤\" literally translates to \"falling\" or \"tumbling\", which can be figuratively interpreted as encountering obstacles and setbacks that can lead to failures and disappointments.\n\nTherefore, I agree that \"If you want to achieve great success, you will definitely stumble and fall\" is an accurate translation of the Chinese text \"你要干出大事业，就肯定会摔跤\" and it captures the intended meaning of the phrase.\n\nNow, what translation candidates do we have? Present them without reasons."
