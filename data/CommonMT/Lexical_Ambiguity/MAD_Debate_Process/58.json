This indicates that the shopping mall is not just any kind of shopping mall, but one that specializes in selling quilts.\n\nTherefore, based on these factors, I believe that the most accurate translation is \"The construction workers are building a shopping mall specifically for selling quilts.\"\n\nNegative side arguing: I disagree with your translation. I believe that the correct English translation of the Chinese text \"这些建筑工人正在盖的是一个专门用于卖被子的商场\" is \"The construction workers are building a shopping mall specifically for selling bedding.\"\n\nMy reasoning for this translation is as follows:\n\n- While the Chinese text does use the word \"被子\" (bèizi), which specifically refers to quilts or comforters, it is also a general term for bedding. Therefore, the shopping mall being built may not necessarily be limited to selling only quilts, but could also sell other types of bedding such as sheets, blankets, and pillows.\n- The Chinese text does not explicitly state that the shopping mall is only for selling quilts. It simply says that it is \"专门用于卖被子的商场\" (zhuānmén yòngyú mài bèizi de shāngchǎng), which can be translated as \"a shopping mall specifically for selling bedding.\" This leaves room for interpretation that the shopping mall may sell other types of bedding besides quilts.\n- Using the more general term \"bedding\" in the translation allows for a broader interpretation of the text, which may be more accurate in conveying the intended meaning.\n\nTherefore, based on these factors, I believe that the most accurate translation is \"The construction workers are building a shopping mall specifically for selling bedding.\"\n\nNow, what translation candidates do we have?
