    "reason": "While both translations accurately capture the meaning of the original Chinese text, the use of liquor in candidate 2 is more accurate as 名酒 is more commonly used to refer to liquor.

                "content": "Affirmative side arguing:\nI agree with your translation, \"He obtained a lot of famous wines from the back door.\" \n\nFirstly, the Chinese character \"搞\" in this context means \"to obtain\" or \"to get,\" which supports the use of \"obtained\" in the translation. \n\nSecondly, \"名酒\" refers to famous or well-known wines, which supports the use of \"famous wines\" in the translation. \n\nLastly, the phrase \"从后门\" literally translates to \"from the back door,\" which can be interpreted as obtaining something through a less official or legitimate means. Therefore, the use of \"from the back door\" in the translation accurately conveys this connotation. \n\nOverall, the translation \"He obtained a lot of famous wines from the back door\" accurately captures the meaning of the original Chinese text.\n\nNegative side arguing: I actually disagree with your translation. I believe a more accurate translation would be \"He got a lot of famous liquor from the back door.\"\n\nFirstly, the Chinese character \"搞\" can have multiple meanings, including \"to do\" or \"to handle.\" In this context, it can be interpreted as \"to get\" or \"to obtain,\" but it can also be interpreted as \"to do something\" or \"to handle something.\" Therefore, the use of \"got\" in the translation is more appropriate as it can encompass both meanings.\n\nSecondly, \"名酒\" can refer to both wine and liquor, but it is more commonly used to refer to liquor. Therefore, the use of \"liquor\" in the translation is more accurate.\n\nLastly, while \"从后门\" does literally translate to \"from the back door,\" it is a common Chinese idiom that means obtaining something through unofficial or illegitimate means. Therefore, the use of \"from the back door\" in the translation is not entirely accurate. Instead, the use of \"from an unofficial source\" or \"through unofficial means\" would be more appropriate.\n\nOverall, the translation \"He got a lot of famous liquor from an unofficial source\" accurately captures the meaning of the original Chinese text.\n\nNow, what translation candidates do we have? Present them without reasons."
