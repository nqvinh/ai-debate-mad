Therefore, it is appropriate to use the word \"scraped\" in the translation.\n\nSecondly, the phrase \"着山顶\" indicates that the airplane made contact with the mountaintop. The use of \"against\" in the translation emphasizes this contact.\n\nFinally, the use of the word \"mountaintop\" instead of \"mountain\" in the translation is more accurate as it specifies the exact point of contact between the airplane and the mountain.\n\nNegative side arguing: I believe the correct translation of \"飞机擦着山顶\" is \"The airplane brushed against the mountaintop.\"\n\nFirstly, the Chinese character \"擦\" can mean both to rub or scrape against something, as well as to brush against something. Therefore, it is appropriate to use the word \"brushed\" in the translation.\n\nSecondly, the phrase \"着山顶\" indicates that the airplane made contact with the mountaintop, but it doesn't necessarily imply that the contact was forceful or caused damage. The use of \"against\" in the translation may imply a more forceful contact than what is intended.\n\nFinally, the use of the word \"mountaintop\" instead of \"mountain\" in the translation is accurate as it specifies the exact point of contact between the airplane and the mountain. However, the use of \"scraped\" may imply a more forceful contact than what is intended by the original Chinese text.\n\nNow, what translation candidates do we have? Present them without reasons."
