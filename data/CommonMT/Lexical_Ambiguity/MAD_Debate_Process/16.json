I understand your perspective, but I still believe that \"预科\" should be translated as \"preparatory course\" rather than \"foundation course.\"\n\nWhile \"预科\" can refer to a program that provides a general foundation for further study in a specific field, it is more commonly used in the context of preparing students for a specific exam or test. In Chinese education, \"预科\" is often used to refer to a program that prepares students for the national college entrance exam, which is a specific test that students must pass in order to enter college.\n\nFurthermore, the term \"preparatory course\" is commonly used in English to refer to a program that prepares students for a specific exam or test. This term is more commonly used than \"foundation course\" in the context of international education.\n\nAdditionally, the term \"preparatory course\" does not necessarily imply that the course is only focused on preparing students for a test or exam. It can also refer to a program that provides a general foundation for further study in a specific field.\n\nTherefore, based on the context and the common usage of the term \"预科,\" I still believe that the most accurate translation of the Chinese text is \"At that time, international students had to stay in a one-year preparatory course.\"\n\nNegative side arguing: Thank you for your response. While I understand your perspective, I still believe that \"预科\" should be translated as \"foundation course\" rather than \"preparatory course.\"\n\nWhile \"预科\" can refer to a program that prepares students for a specific exam or test, it is also commonly used in the context of providing a general foundation for further study in a specific field. In this case, the text does not specify what the preparatory course is for, but it does indicate that it is a one-year program. \n\nFurthermore, the term \"foundation course\" is commonly used in English to refer to a program that provides a general foundation for further study in a specific field. This term is more commonly used than \"preparatory course\" in the context of international education.\n\nAdditionally, the term \"preparatory course\" may imply that the course is specifically designed to prepare students for a test or exam, while the term \"foundation course\" implies a broader focus on providing a general foundation for further study.\n\nTherefore, based on the context and the common usage of the term \"预科,\" I still believe that the most accurate translation of the Chinese text is \"At that time, international students had to stay in a one-year foundation course.\"\n\nYou, as the moderator, will evaluate both sides' translations and determine if there is a clear preference for a translation candidate.
