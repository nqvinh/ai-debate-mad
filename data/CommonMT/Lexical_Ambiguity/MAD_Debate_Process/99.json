    "reason": "While both translations accurately convey the meaning of the original Chinese text, the negative sides translation is more accurate in terms of the specific wording used in the original text. The use of caring for pregnant women in the affirmative sides translation is not explicitly stated in the original text, while the negative sides use of research on pregnant women is more accurate. Additionally, the negative sides use of at risk of encountering difficulties is a more precise translation of the phrase 容易陷入难产的境地 than the affirmative sides easily trapped in a difficult situation. Therefore, the correct English translation is: His research on pregnant women is at risk of encountering difficulties under current research conditions.",

Therefore, it is more accurate to translate it as \"research on pregnant women\" rather than \"caring for pregnant women.\"\n\nSecondly, the phrase \"容易陷入难产的境地\" can be translated to \"at risk of encountering difficulties.\" While \"难产\" (difficult childbirth) implies a sense of danger or risk, it does not necessarily mean that the research will be trapped in a difficult situation.
