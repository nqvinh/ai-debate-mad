While I appreciate your perspective, I still believe that my original translation is more accurate.\n\nRegarding \"好几次,\" I understand your point that the phrase \"已经浮沉过\" implies that the person has experienced a significant number of ups and downs in their career. However, I still believe that \"several times\" is a more appropriate translation because it implies a smaller number of experiences than \"many times.\" Additionally, the use of \"已经\" (already) suggests that the person has had a certain amount of experience, but not necessarily an overwhelming amount.\n\nRegarding \"浮沉,\" I agree that it is a more general term that can refer to any kind of fluctuation. However, in the context of officialdom, \"risen and fallen\" is a more precise and accurate translation because it specifically conveys the idea of moving up and down in a hierarchical or social structure, which is a common theme in this context.\n\nOverall, I still believe that \"He has risen and fallen several times in the officialdom and has a lot of experience\" is a more precise and accurate translation of the original Chinese text.\n\nNegative side arguing: Thank you for your response. While I understand your reasoning, I still believe that my translation is more accurate.\n\nRegarding \"好几次,\" I agree that \"several times\" can be a valid translation, but I still believe that \"many times\" is a more appropriate translation in this context. The phrase \"已经浮沉过\" implies that the person has experienced a significant number of ups and downs in their career, which suggests that \"many times\" is a more accurate translation.\n\nRegarding \"浮沉,\" I agree that \"risen and fallen\" can be a valid interpretation of the term, but I still believe that \"ups and downs\" is a more commonly used and accurate translation in this context. The phrase \"官场已经浮沉过好几次了\" suggests that the person has experienced a range of successes and failures in their career, which can include both upward and downward movements in a hierarchical or social structure.\n\nOverall, I believe that \"He has experienced many ups and downs in the officialdom and has a lot of experience\" is a more accurate translation of the original Chinese text.\n\nYou, as the moderator, will evaluate both sides' translations and determine if there is a clear preference for a translation candidate. If so, please summarize your reasons for supporting affirmative/negative side and give the final translation that you think is correct, and the debate will conclude. If not, the debate will continue to the next round.
