Therefore, it is possible that the items sold in the second-hand market are not only cheap but also of low quality.\n\nFurthermore, the use of \"一般都是\" in the Chinese text implies that the low quality of the items sold in the second-hand market is a common occurrence. This suggests that the low price of the items may be due to their poor quality.\n\nTherefore, based on the negative connotation of \"贱货\" and the use of \"一般都是,\" I still believe that the correct translation is \"The items sold in the second-hand market are generally of low quality.\"\n\nNegative side arguing: I understand your perspective, and I can see how \"贱货\" can be interpreted as \"low quality\" due to its negative connotation in Chinese. However, I still believe that the correct translation of the Chinese text \"二手市场卖的一般都是贱货\" is \"The items sold in the second-hand market are generally cheap.\"\n\nThe reason for this is that \"贱货\" can also be translated as \"cheap goods\" or \"inexpensive products,\" which suggests that the low price of the items sold in the second-hand market is the main reason for their classification as \"贱货.\" Additionally, the use of \"一般都是\" in the Chinese text implies that the low price of the items is a common occurrence, which further supports the translation of \"贱货\" as \"cheap.\"\n\nWhile it is possible that the items sold in the second-hand market are of low quality, I believe that the emphasis in the Chinese text is on their low price rather than their quality. Therefore, I still believe that the correct translation is \"The items sold in the second-hand market are generally cheap.\"\n\nYou, as the moderator, will evaluate both sides' translations and determine if there is a clear preference for a translation candidate. If so, please summarize your reasons for supporting affirmative/negative side and give the final translation that you think is correct, and the debate will conclude.
