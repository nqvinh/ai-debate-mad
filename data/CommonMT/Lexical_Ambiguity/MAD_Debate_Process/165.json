While it is true that \"私房\" can refer to both illegal structures and private houses, the context of the sentence suggests that it specifically refers to illegal structures. The use of \"拆除\" and \"都要\" further emphasize that the structures being referred to are not legal and that action will be taken against all structures in the area.\n\nRegarding the possibility that some private houses in the area are legal but will still be affected by the demolition, it is important to note that the Chinese text specifically uses the term \"私房,\" which refers to structures that are not legal. Therefore, it is unlikely that legal private houses would be affected by the demolition.\n\nOverall, while \"私房\" can refer to both illegal structures and private houses, the context of the sentence suggests that it specifically refers to illegal structures. The use of \"拆除\" and \"都要\" further emphasize that all illegal structures in the area will be affected. Therefore, I still believe that the translation \"All the illegal structures in this area will be demolished\" is more accurate.\n\nNegative side arguing: Thank you for your response. I understand your perspective, and I agree that the use of \"拆除\" and \"都要\" suggest that the structures being referred to are not legal and that action will be taken against all structures in the area.\n\nRegarding the term \"私房,\" while it is true that it specifically refers to structures that are not legal, it is still possible that some private houses in the area are legal but will still be affected by the demolition if they are located in the same area as the illegal structures.\n\nHowever, I agree that the overall context of the sentence suggests that the focus is on illegal structures, and the use of \"私房\" further emphasizes this. Therefore, I agree that the translation \"All the illegal structures in this area will be demolished\" is more accurate.\n\nThank you for the discussion.\n\nYou, as the moderator, will evaluate both sides' translations and determine if there is a clear preference for a translation candidate. If so, please summarize your reasons for supporting affirmative/negative side and give the final translation that you think is correct, and the debate will conclude.

Now please output your answer in json format, with the format as follows: {\"Whether there is a preference\": \"Yes or No\", \"Supported Side\": \"Affirmative or Negative\", \"Reason\": \"\", \"Correct Translation\": \"\"}"

While it is true that \"私房\" can refer to illegal structures, it can also refer to private houses that are not necessarily illegal. Therefore, the translation \"private houses\" is a valid option.\n\nSecondly, the phrase \"都要拆除\" does indicate a mandatory action, but it does not necessarily mean that all structures will be demolished. It could also mean that all structures will be inspected and only those that are deemed illegal or unsafe will be demolished.\n\nFinally, the phrase \"这一带\" can be translated as \"around here\" or \"in this neighborhood\" as well as \"this area.\" The specific meaning depends on the context in which it is used.\n\nOverall, the translation \"All the private houses in this area must be demolished\" accurately conveys the meaning of the original Chinese text.\n\nNow, what translation candidates do we have?
