This phrase is commonly used to describe someone who is very skilled or successful in a particular activity.\n\nSecondly, the verb \"猜\" in Chinese means to guess or to solve a puzzle. Therefore, \"他猜谜语\" can be translated as \"He guesses riddles\" or \"He solves puzzles.\"\n\nPutting these two parts together, \"他猜谜语百发百中\" can be translated as \"He guesses riddles with a 100% success rate,\" which accurately conveys the meaning of the original Chinese text.\n\nNegative side arguing: I disagree with your translation. I believe the correct English translation of the Chinese text \"他猜谜语百发百中\" is \"He solves riddles with a 100% success rate.\"\n\nWhile \"猜\" can mean \"to guess,\" it can also mean \"to solve\" in the context of puzzles or riddles. Therefore, \"他猜谜语\" can be translated as \"He solves riddles\" or \"He solves puzzles.\"\n\nAdditionally, \"百发百中\" means to have a 100% success rate, but it specifically refers to hitting a target with every shot. In the context of solving riddles, it means that he is able to solve every riddle with a 100% success rate.\n\nTherefore, \"他猜谜语百发百中\" can be translated as \"He solves riddles with a 100% success rate,\" which accurately conveys the meaning of the original Chinese text.\n\nNow, what translation candidates do we have?
