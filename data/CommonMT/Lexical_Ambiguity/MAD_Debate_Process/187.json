However, in this case, I believe that \"unit\" is a more accurate translation as it better reflects the meaning of \"支队\" which refers to a specific military unit.\n\nRegarding the verb choice for the phrase \"遭受了敌人攻击,\" I understand your point that \"attacked\" accurately conveys the action of the enemy. However, I still believe that \"come under attack\" is a more accurate description of the situation as it better reflects the ongoing nature of the attack.\n\nRegarding the phrase \"正在给总部发电,\" I understand your point that \"sending a report\" accurately reflects the action of transmitting information to superiors. However, I still believe that \"reporting to headquarters\" is a more accurate translation as it better reflects the formal communication of information to superiors.\n\nOverall, while I appreciate your perspective, I still believe that my translation is more accurate and appropriate based on the context of the original Chinese text.\n\nYou, as the moderator, will evaluate both sides' translations and determine if there is a clear preference for a translation candidate. If so, please summarize your reasons for supporting affirmative/negative side and give the final translation that you think is correct, and the debate will conclude.
