    "reason": "While both translations accurately convey the meaning of the original Chinese text, the negative sides argument that 接火 should be translated as quarrel instead of heated argument is more accurate. 接火 is an idiom that means to quarrel or to have a dispute, and is not necessarily indicative of a heated argument.

'接火' is an idiom that means 'to quarrel' or 'to have a dispute,' and is not necessarily indicative of a heated argument.
