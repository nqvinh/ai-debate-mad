The literal translation of \"登上青云\" is \"to climb up to the blue sky.\"\n\nTherefore, when translating the sentence \"他已经是一个登上青云的人\" into English, I believe the most accurate and idiomatic way to convey the intended meaning is to use the phrase \"successful person\" to capture the sense of accomplishment and status implied by the original Chinese phrase."

Therefore, using the phrase \"pinnacle of success\" more accurately conveys the sense of achieving the highest level of success possible.\n\nAdditionally, I believe it's important to note that \"登上\" (dēng shàng) specifically means \"to climb up to\" or \"to ascend to,\" so using language that conveys this upward motion, as well as the achievement of the highest possible level of success, is essential in capturing the full implications of the original Chinese phrase.\n\nDo you agree with my perspective?

I can see how the phrase \"pinnacle of success\" can better capture the idea of reaching the ultimate goal of success, and how \"to climb up to\" can convey the idea of upward progression towards this goal. However, I do have a few concerns with this translation.\n\nFirstly, while \"青云\" (qīng yún) does refer specifically to the highest point in the sky, I would argue that in the context of this idiom, the color \"青\" more broadly conveys the sense of something auspicious or lucky, while \"云\" (yún) symbolizes the vastness and limitless possibilities of the sky. As a result, \"登上青云\" could also be interpreted as achieving great success and good fortune, not just reaching the highest point.\n\nSecondly, while \"pinnacle of success\" is a valid translation of \"登上青云,\" it is also a more figurative or abstract phrase, and may not capture the concrete sense of achievement implied by the Chinese idiom. In contrast, the phrase \"successful person\" is a more straightforward and concrete way of conveying the idea of someone who has achieved success.\n\nOverall, while I can see the merits of your translation, I still believe that \"He has already become a successful person\" is the most accurate and idiomatic way to translate the sentence in question."
