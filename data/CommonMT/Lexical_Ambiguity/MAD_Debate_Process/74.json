The correct translation of the Chinese text \"公司招聘了几个花瓶，是专门用来招待客人的\" is \"The company has hired several decorative figures who are specifically used to entertain guests.\" \n\nMy reasons for this translation are as follows:\n\n- The term \"花瓶\" (huā píng) in Chinese can refer to a decorative vase or figurine, but in this context, it is more likely referring to a decorative figure. This is because the sentence specifies that these \"花瓶\" are used to entertain guests, which suggests that they are not functional objects like vases, but rather decorative objects that serve a specific purpose.\n- The phrase \"专门用来招待客人的\" (zhuān mén yòng lái zhāo dài kè rén de) translates to \"specifically used to entertain guests.\" This further supports the idea that these \"花瓶\" are not functional objects, but rather decorative figures that are used to create a certain atmosphere or impression for guests.\n- The use of the word \"hired\" in the translation implies that these decorative figures are people who have been employed by the company. While this may seem odd at first, it is a common metaphorical usage of the word \"hire\" in English. In this context, it means that the company has acquired these decorative figures for the purpose of using them to entertain guests.\n\nOverall, I believe that \"The company has hired several decorative figures who are specifically used to entertain guests\" is a more accurate translation of the Chinese text than \"The company has hired several flower vases, which are specifically used to entertain guests.\""
