The word \"deviation\" in \"Deviation from correct principles\" is a more general term that could refer to any kind of deviation, whereas \"departure\" specifically implies a departure from a set course or standard.\n\nTherefore, \"Departure from the correct principles\" accurately conveys the meaning of the original Chinese text and is a more precise translation than \"Deviation from correct principles.\"\n\nNegative side arguing: Yes, I agree with your perspective that \"Departure from the correct principles\" is a more accurate and precise translation of the original Chinese text than \"Deviation from correct principles.\"\n\nAs you mentioned, the use of the definite article \"the\" emphasizes that there is a specific set of principles being referred to, which is important in accurately conveying the meaning of the original Chinese text. It suggests that there is a particular standard or set of principles that the text is referring to, rather than just any principles that happen to be correct.\n\nFurthermore, the word \"departure\" in \"Departure from the correct principles\" implies a deliberate and intentional deviation from the correct principles, which is an important aspect of the original text. It suggests that there are consequences for deviating from these principles, and that the departure is not accidental or unintentional.\n\nIn addition, \"Departure from the correct principles\" is a more precise translation because it captures the nuance of the original Chinese text. The word \"deviation\" in \"Deviation from correct principles\" is a more general term that could refer to any kind of deviation, whereas \"departure\" specifically implies a departure from a set course or standard.\n\nTherefore, \"Departure from the correct principles\" accurately conveys the meaning of the original Chinese text and is a more precise translation than \"Deviation from correct principles.\" I agree with your perspective.\n\nYou, as the moderator, will evaluate both sides' translations and determine if there is a clear preference for a translation candidate. If so, please summarize your reasons for supporting affirmative/negative side and give the final translation that you think is correct, and the debate will conclude. If not, the debate will continue to the next round. Now please output your answer in json format, with the format as follows: {\"Whether there is a preference\": \"Yes or No\", \"Supported Side\": \"Affirmative or Negative\", \"Reason\": \"\", \"Correct Translation\": \"\"}"
