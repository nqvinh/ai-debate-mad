While I appreciate your perspective, I still believe that \"He has a plan in his mind regarding this matter\" is the more accurate translation.\n\nFirstly, while \"谱\" can indeed mean \"notation\" or \"score\" in certain contexts, in this particular context, it is more commonly used to mean \"plan\" or \"strategy.\" The phrase \"心里有着谱\" implies that the person not only has a good understanding of the matter but also has a clear plan or strategy in mind.\n\nSecondly, while \"regarding\" may not be necessary to convey the meaning of \"对于\" in this context, it does emphasize the specific relationship between the person and the matter at hand. It indicates that the person has a specific plan or strategy related to the matter.\n\nIn conclusion, while \"He has a good grasp of this matter\" is a possible translation, I still believe that \"He has a plan in his mind regarding this matter\" is the more accurate and appropriate translation of the Chinese text \"对于这件事情，他心里有着谱.\"\n\nNegative side arguing: Thank you for your response. While I understand your reasoning, I still believe that \"He has a good grasp of this matter\" is the more accurate translation.\n\nFirstly, while \"谱\" can indeed mean \"plan\" or \"strategy,\" it can also mean \"notation\" or \"score\" in certain contexts. Therefore, it is important to consider the context in which the word is used. In this case, the phrase \"心里有着谱\" implies that the person has a good understanding or grasp of the matter at hand, rather than a specific plan or strategy.\n\nSecondly, while \"regarding\" may emphasize the specific relationship between the person and the matter at hand, it is not necessary to convey the meaning of \"对于\" in this context. \"About\" or \"concerning\" can also accurately convey the meaning of the phrase.\n\nIn conclusion, while \"He has a plan in his mind regarding this matter\" is a possible translation, I still believe that \"He has a good grasp of this matter\" is the more accurate and appropriate translation of the Chinese text \"对于这件事情，他心里有着谱.\"\n\nYou, as the moderator, will evaluate both sides' translations and determine if there is a clear preference for a translation candidate.
