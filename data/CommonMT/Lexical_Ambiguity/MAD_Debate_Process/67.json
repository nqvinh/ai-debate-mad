The original Chinese text also uses the first-person pronoun \"我,\" which further supports this interpretation.\n\nIn summary, the correct translation of the Chinese text \"我起早惯了，睡懒觉不舒服\" is \"I am used to getting up early, and I feel uncomfortable when I sleep in.\"\n\nNow, what translation candidates do we have? Present them without reasons."
