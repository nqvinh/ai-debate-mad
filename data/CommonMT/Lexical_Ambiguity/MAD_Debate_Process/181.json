It could simply mean that the person is walking on the street that is adjacent to the clothing store.\n\nTherefore, based on the lack of clear indication that the person is crossing the street and the more general meaning of \"旁边的马路,\" I agree that \"He is walking on the street next to this clothing store\" is the more accurate translation.\n\nNegative side arguing: Yes, I agree with your perspective that \"walking\" is a more accurate translation in this particular sentence.\n\nAs we have discussed, the Chinese text does not provide any clear indication that the person is crossing the street. While \"穿\" can mean \"to cross,\" it can also mean \"to pass through\" or \"to traverse,\" which could simply imply that the person is walking along the street next to the clothing store.\n\nFurthermore, the phrase \"旁边的马路\" can be translated as \"the road beside\" or \"the street beside,\" which does not necessarily imply that the person is crossing the street. It could simply mean that the person is walking on the street that is adjacent to the clothing store.\n\nTherefore, based on the lack of clear indication that the person is crossing the street and the more general meaning of \"旁边的马路,\" I agree that \"He is walking on the street next to this clothing store\" is the more accurate translation.\n\nYou, as the moderator, will evaluate both sides' translations and determine if there is a clear preference for a translation candidate. If so, please summarize your reasons for supporting affirmative/negative side and give the final translation that you think is correct, and the debate will conclude. If not, the debate will continue to the next round. Now please output your answer in json format, with the format as follows: {\"Whether there is a preference\": \"Yes or No\", \"Supported Side\": \"Affirmative or Negative\", \"Reason\": \"\", \"Correct Translation\": \"\"}"
