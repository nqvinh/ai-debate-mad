                "content": "Affirmative side arguing:\nI agree with your translation, \"You should tell the truth and not bite others randomly.\" \n\nThe Chinese text \"你要说实话，不要乱咬别人\" can be broken down into two parts. The first part, \"你要说实话\" means \"you should tell the truth.\" The second part, \"不要乱咬别人\" means \"do not bite others randomly.\" \n\nThe use of the word \"乱\" in the second part emphasizes the randomness or lack of reason behind the biting. This implies that the speaker is cautioning against not only physical biting, but also verbal attacks or harmful actions towards others. \n\nTherefore, the translation \"You should tell the truth and not bite others randomly\" accurately conveys the meaning of the original Chinese text.\n\nNegative side arguing: I disagree with your translation. I believe the correct English translation of the Chinese text \"你要说实话，不要乱咬别人\" is \"You should speak the truth, and not slander others.\"\n\nWhile the first part of the Chinese text, \"你要说实话,\" does mean \"you should tell the truth,\" the second part, \"不要乱咬别人,\" does not necessarily refer to physical biting. The word \"乱\" can also mean \"randomly\" or \"carelessly.\" Therefore, the phrase \"不要乱咬别人\" can be interpreted as \"do not speak ill of others carelessly or without reason.\"\n\nIn this context, \"咬\" can be translated as \"slander\" or \"speak ill of.\" Therefore, the complete translation of the Chinese text would be \"You should speak the truth, and not slander others.\"\n\nThis translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original Chinese text, which is to encourage honesty and discourage harmful speech towards others.\n\nNow, what translation candidates do we have? Present them without reasons."
